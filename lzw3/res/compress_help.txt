NAME
    compress - compress files using LZW algorithm

SYNOPSIS
    compress [-v] [-r] [-k] [-t] [-d] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Compress arbitrary file(s) using LZW algorithm.

    Replaces the original file with the compressed one,
    appending the extension ".Z".

    The replacement is skipped in case the size of the compressed
    file is not lower than the size of the original one (unless -f is specified).

    The file list can contain either files or directories.

    -r
        Recursively compress the files inside the directories
        within the given file list.
        If not specified, directories in the file list are skipped.

    -v
        Prints information about the handled files and the percentage of
        saved space for each compressed file.

    -t
        Prints the time spent for compress each file.

    -k
        Keeps the original files instead of replace those with the
        compressed ones.

    -f
        Force to compress and keep the compressed file, even if the size
        of the compressed file is higher than the size of the original one.

    -d
        Prints debug messages.

EXAMPLES

    Compress a directory recursively:
        compress -r /home/user/Docs/Project

    Compress a list of files showing compression stats:
        compress -v /home/user/Docs/f1.txt /home/user/Docs/f2.txt

    Compress a list of files keeping the originals and showing compress times:
        compress -k -v -t /home/user/Docs/f1.txt /home/user/Docs/f2.txt
